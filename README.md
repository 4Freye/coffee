Guidelines for creating new feature-creating functions:
* if you need to create a function, you can add it under the FeatureCreate class in the code
* The FeatureCreate class takes a dataframe and a column name (as a string) as inputs.
* If it is the case that you need more than one column to create a new feature, then you should create a new class that takes multiple columns as inputs.
